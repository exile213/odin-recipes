    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>These baked chicken tenders have a deliciously crispy panko bread crumb coating for that extra crunch factor without the guilt of frying!<br>
         You can marinate the tenders in light buttermilk in the refrigerator for 1 hour instead of dipping in the beaten egg.This easy pancake recipe doesn't require<br>
         much thought early in the morning and the pancakes taste great!
