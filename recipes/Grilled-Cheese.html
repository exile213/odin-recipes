    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This recipe calls for plain white sandwich bread. You could also use sourdough, brioche, or even ciabatta. <br>
        You can really make grilled cheese with any type of bread you like, but you should make sure the loaf is sturdy enough to handle the heat. <br>
        Thinly sliced, delicate breads will quickly fall apart.
    </p>
